    <p>Well, I want to start this recipe with a litlle bit of background; the escalope normande is a typical french dish that comes from Normandie, a region of france. It's more usually made with chicken and it uses local ingredients such as calvados, crême fraiche from Normandie and even some apple sometimes. It is often made with mushroom from Paris and can be served with a variety of different things.</p>
    <p>Enjoy !</p>
